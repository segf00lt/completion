Possibly allow saving and loading markov chain models with these
functions:

def Save(self, file):
    np.savez_compressed(file, weights=self.weights, lexicon=self.lexicon)

def Load(self, file):
    loaded = np.load(file)
    self.lexicon = loaded['lexicon']
    #self.raw = loaded['raw']
    self.weights = loaded['weights']
